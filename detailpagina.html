    <h1 id="plot">Plot</h1>
    <p>This action drama follows a mysterious man who has multiple jobs as a garage mechanic, a Hollywood stuntman and a
        getaway driver seems to be trying to escape his shady past as he falls for his neighbor - whose husband is in
        prison and who's looking after her child alone. Meanwhile, his garage mechanic boss is trying to set up a race
        team using gangland money, which implicates our driver as he is to be used as the race team's main driver. Our
        hero gets more than he bargained for when he meets the man who is married to the woman he loves.

    <h1 id="review">Featured review</h1>
    <h3>Film Noir meets Hammer Hardened Hero Maker meets Gangster Heavy Metal</h3>
    <p>Ryan Gosling brings down the hammer on that line where logic reason and self preservation become secondary to
        protecting what is important to you. There are a few moments where he doesn't just cross that line but
        obliterates it completely.<br>
        <br>
        Beautifully crafted pounding action thriller with twisted humor and seriously hard core violence. Compelling
        tenderness from characters that are unsophisticated in the best sense of the word.<br>
        <br>
        This film will go down as one of the best Action films in decades. Car chases that rival and extend beyond
        Bullitt and French Connection. Violence that bursts out of the screen like a horror film or a bad dream by David
        Cronenberg. Passing moments of tenderness that are drawn out until you are slowly pulled into the emotional
        world of the protagonists.<br>
        <br>
        Something so powerful, especially when it works, is the use of sharp and dramatic Camera Angles in Drive that
        mirror the emotional moment of the story drawing you into the characters world.<br>
        <br>
        View and angles often extremely low angled and tilted sharply upward, effective at expanding the feeling of
        voyeurism of being at the dinner table or in the adjacent seat, right in the room with the characters while
        safely looking up from some shadow or nook or cranny. Very emotionally transcendent cinematography.<br>
        <br>
        Night footage was amazingly successful at capturing the range of light and shadows, on a technical level the
        audio and video were strong and assured. Not only the first robbery but all the way through the film right up to
        the final resolution of the plot, the night was a familiar environment for major turns in the story (pun
        intended).<br>
        <br>
        I will return hopefully soon to expand on this review, but I had to write something tonight because this film is
        ten times more badass than any Transporter or Fast and Furious fare that is usually sold in their all too
        obvious packaging.<br>
        <br>
        Drive leaves them all in the Dust.
